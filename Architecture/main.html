        Iconic Buildings Every Architecture Lover Needs to Visit in Person</h2>

        a chosen
        destination is to look at its renowned architecture. While any location’s celebrated museums,
        manicured gardens, and diverse food scene offer insight into its culture, it’s the one-of-a-kind
        structures that create its landscape, which reveal a deeper level of its history and understanding
        of its people.

        For as long as humans have been on this planet, architects, engineers, and everyday people have
        worked together to develop buildings and landmarks to withstand the test of time and give insights
        into their societies. Narrowing down a list of the most celebrated structures can be tricky, but the
        ones seen here not only act as hallmarks of the regions' architectural styles, but also offer a
        closer look at the people who live or once lived there.</p>
